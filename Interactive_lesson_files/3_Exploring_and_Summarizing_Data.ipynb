Before we move on to any kind of statistical analysis or fancy machine learning, we must spend time with our data so we know their limits, their ability to give business insights by themselves, and their ability to be used in down stream modeling. Many times basic exploratory analysis is enough to satisfy our need to answer a business question â€” we shouldn't think that we always have to do fancy statistical analysis or machine learning to keep our jobs! \n",
