        "Your job as an analyst is to extract meaningful information about the workforce from available data-but before that happens, you have to check to see that the data you have is accurate and complete, and that it satisfies the requirements for your analysis. \n",
        "\n",
        "A common starting point for analytics projects is preparing roster information from HR Information Systems for analysis. These data include one row of data per employee, and multiple columns that contain specific information about the workforce (such as name, email address, department, tenure, birthday, and other demographic information). This information can also be limited to a specific population in a particular status, such as active employees (headcount), terminated employees, transfers in, transfers out, and more. \n",
        "\n",
        "In this lession we'll work with a a synthetic headcount (roster) dataset which features the structure and contents seen in many HRIS data extract. \n",
        "\n",
        "We'll work to highlight things common things you might have to do when preparing data for analysis, such as **creating columns, dropping records, replacing values, merging (vlookup) data from other files, and more.** In the next section, we will perform some basic summarization of the data we clean and produce in this section.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, this is a simplified tutorial. It's worth taking a look at the __[Panda's Data Wrangling cheat-sheet](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/doc/cheatsheet/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)__ and the  __[Pandas library's 10-minute introduction to Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html)__  for a more technical introduction to common tasks you'll need to perform in data claning tasks. For now, this is a general overview that's hopefully useful to you to get started working with HR data.\n",
